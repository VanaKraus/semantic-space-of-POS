# I'm the one who takes upon the task of cleaning the whole thing up

I put the protocols from the 3 runs I did into the [`misc`](misc) directory. Even though the file names remain unchanged, the file structure can be different. Throughout the runs I also edited some of the files. Steps described in [the protocol for the Czech CoNLL17 corpus](misc/protocol-cz-conll17.md) are the most recent ones.

[`misc/Penn-POS.tsv`](misc/Penn-POS.tsv) contains the mapping I used to convert Penn Treebank tags into English POS.
